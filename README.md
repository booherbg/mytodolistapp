# mytodolistapp
a sample to do list to showcase my skills, enter information and click the first button to post your task, use the second button to timespamp your start time, and the last button to timestamp a finish time. If you scroll your mouse over the "place mouse here for help" section, a pop-up will appear giving further instructions. Layout is done with HTML, styling and some functionlity is done with CSS, and JavaScript is used to create most functions.
